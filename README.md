This repository contains experiments carried out on CIFAR10 dataset using various Convolutional Neural Network Architectures

Experiments include:
1) Baseline CNN model to measure classification performance
2) RandomSearch for hyperparameter optimization for above CNN model
3) Using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization using hyperopt package
4) A deeper CNN for improving performance over the above mentioned baseline model

All code in Keras with TensorFlow backend
